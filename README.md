## Overview of GitHub Browser Basics Instruction Guide

Our guide on GitHub Browser Basics is meant to provide you with the minimum skills you need to use GitHub as a standalone product and to introduce you to some of the valuable features it has available for developers.
The major topics we want to cover in this instruction manual include:
* Configuring your GitHub account settings.
* Creating and deleting repositories.
* Creating, modifying, and deleting files.

During the initial stages of the project, our team of three brainstormed various instruction manual ideas. We originally planned to create an instruction manual for advanced Git and GitHub features. However, due to the scale of these features, we scaled this project back to include solely basic GitHub features on a browser.

For the execution of this project, we divided the work based on primary task, but kept in communication through Discord and Zoom. We had weekly meetings to check progress and set manual standards.

We were able to remain in near perfect contact using the various digital communication means at our disposal and were able to complete the project despite multiple simultaneously due deliverables.

We believe that the key success for a project are communication and planning. Which allowed us to balance all external work and this project.

## Creation of Our Guide
This guide involved the use of multiple different applications and coding languages including applications such as Visual Studio Code, languages such as Markdown and CSS, and themes such as Jekyll.

### Visual Studio Code
The main application we used to create this instruction manual was Visual Studio Code, which we used in our Web Development course. It provides excellent functionality for writing Markdown, including a best practice style checker.

### Markdown
This was the main language used to create this instruction manual. This was the first time we worked with Markdown, so we had to learn it as we went. The results were that we found that markdown required less code than an equivalent website of the same style using HTML and CSS.

The main Markdown topics we learned included:
* Headings
* Lists
* Indentation
* Breaks
* Code blocks 
* Tables
* Integrating links. 
* Adding Images
* Creating Boxes 
* Adding CSS styles

These Markdown skills will be essential moving forward because all README files and documentation is usually written in Markdown, regardless of programming language.

### HTML / CSS 
We used inline HTML and CSS elements and styles to supplement our Markdown and provide a more unique design. 

### Jekyll Theme
We used the Jekyll theme to structure our instruction manual because it simplified our website design, which freed us up to focus on the more essential content of our manual.
This is a free, open-source theme that we forked and edited to suite our needs.

### Readability and Images
To improve the readability of our manual we used images heavily to clarify most steps allowing first time users to not get lost.

### Testing
We personally went through the process of following each task multiple times, under varying conditions to find any unusual bugs that could arise.

## Conclusion
This was not a trivial project because it involved not only reviewing the topic for our instruction manual, but also learning the skills needed to present our instruction manual. As a group we were able to effectively disperse the work amongst all members while keeping a unified front on all styling and design decisions.

We learned the importance of clear and concise instructions that allow users to easily follow potentially complicated steps accurately. This in conjunction with the importance of accurate and clear documentation is the largest take away we had from this project.

Thank you for reading our GitHub Brower Basics instruction manual. We hope that you will see the value and importance of understanding and using GitHub in the future.
