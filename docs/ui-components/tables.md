# Accessing the Settings page

---

After signing up and logging in for the first time, you would be able to access this _Settings_ page in two different ways.

!["2 Ways to access to Settings from the Home Page"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/HomePageToProfile-edited.png?raw=true)

The one described here will be your default choice, as it allows you to access the full configuration of the _User Profile_ page from any other page inside your account.

|   **Note:** The second choice, which by clicking on the green **Edit profile** button redirects you to the same _User Profile_ section of the _Settings_ page, is only available as an initial tip to first time users.

**1.** Click on the most right side button of the navigation page to open the menu.

**2.** Select **Settings** from the opened dropdown menu.

At this point, you will be redirected to the _User Profile_ section of the _Settings_ page of your account.
