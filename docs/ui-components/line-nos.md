This section is not a part of basic configuration for a newly created user account. However, it will help you with some steps that may become handy after a while.

In this account section of the _Settings_ page, you can change your GitHub username, export account data whenever you intend to migrate it from this account, and delete your account if you intend to remove this account and its data from GitHub.

## Changing Username

Changing a previously chosen **GitHub username**, which is different from changing your publicly shown _Profile Name_, may be required in special situations. Here, we will cover the required process if, at any point, you decide to do so.

**1.** Click on the **Change username** button after reading about **unintended side effects** by the provided link and probable consequences of changing a user account.
