## Accessing the Settings page

After signing up and logging in for the first time, there are two different ways to access and make changes to this _Settings_ page.

!["2 Ways to access to Settings from the Home Page"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/HomePageToProfile-edited.png?raw=true)

Although at this point, there are two separate ways available to access to this page, the first one described here will be your default choice, as it allows you to access the full configuration of the _User Profile_ page when you are logged in from any other page.

   **Note:** The second choice, which by clicking on the green **Edit profile** button redirects you to the same _User Profile_ section of the _Settings_ page, is only available as an initial tip to first time users.
 

**1.** Click on the most right side button of the navigation page to open the menu.

!["Steps to access Settings from the Home Page"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/HomePageToProfile-edited2.png?raw=true)

**2.** Select **Settings** from the opened dropdown menu.

  At this point, you will be redirected to the _User Profile_ section of the _Settings_ page of your account.

  By clicking on each item of the left sidebar, any section of this _Settings_ page can be chosen. Here, we will walk through 4 of these sections to help you set up the basic configuration.

  It is recommended to start from _Emails_ section before setting up the _Profile_ section. By configuring this section first, there will be no need to go back and forth between different sections.
  {: .p-3rem }

## Emails section

During the sign up proccess to create your GitHub account, you have been asked to provide an email address to connect your GitHub account to your email account. That email address has been stored as your _Primary Email Address_ which will be used as a way to answer security related checks for your account, making backups, and also for sending notifications when you are follownig, watching, or working with others inside GitHub. However, you may intend to add another email address for different reasons, such as adding a private email address beside your work email, changing your connected email address to your GitHub account, or having two connected email addresses for security related reasons.

By following this section, you would be able to add other email addresses for different purposes, change your _Primary Email Address_ to another email address, and choose a setting for your _Backup Email Address_ if needed.

  **Caution:** None of these steps are necessary if you do not intend to add other email accounts to your GitHub account.
