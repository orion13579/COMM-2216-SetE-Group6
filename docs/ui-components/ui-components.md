# Account Settings Configuration
{: .no_toc }

To start working with GitHub after creating a user account, it is essential to set some basic configurations in the _Settings_ page of your account. Beside these settings, there are a number of other basic configurations that may become handy in the near future such as changing password, or connecting another email address to your account.

The first part of this instruction manual covered under the topic of _Account Settings Configuration_ goes over how to set these setting both prior to using different GitHub services and during your contribution period. 

To start this configuration, proceed to the [Accessing the Settings page](https://orion13579.github.io/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/docs/ui-components/tables/) subsection.
