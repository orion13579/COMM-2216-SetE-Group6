# **Account Settings Configuration**
{: .no_toc }

---

To start working with GitHub after creating a user account, it is essential to set some basic configurations in the Settings page of your account. Besides these settings, some other basic configurations may become handy soon, such as changing the password or connecting another email address to your account.

The first part of this instruction manual (covered under the topic of Account Settings Configuration) goes over how to set these settings. Some may be required before using different GitHub services, and some during your contribution period.

To begin, proceed to the [Accessing the Settings page](https://orion13579.github.io/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/docs/ui-components/tables/) subsection.
