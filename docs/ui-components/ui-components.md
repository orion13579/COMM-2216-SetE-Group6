# Basic Configuration of User Settings

To start working with GitHub after creating a user account, it is vital to set some basic configurations in the _Settings_.

This section goes over how to set these cofigurations before starting to work with your account.

After signing up and logging in for the first time, there are 3 different ways to access and make changes to this _Settings_ page.

!["Access to User Profile from Home Page"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/HomePageToProfile-edited.png?raw=true)

Although at this point, there are two separate ways available to access to this page, the first one described here will be your default choice, as it allows you to access the full configuration of the _User Profile_ page when you are logged in from any other page.

Note: The second choice, which by clicking on the green _Edit profile_ button redirects you to the same _User Profile_ section of the _Settings_ page, is only available as an initial tip to first time users.

1- Click on the most right side button of the navigation page to open the menu.

2- Select _Settings_ (1st option shown in the figure above)

At this point, you will be redirected to the _User Profile_ section of the _Settings_ page of your account.
