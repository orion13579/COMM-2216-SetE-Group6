This section of the GitHub account's _Settings_ is not a necessity for newly created accounts. However, it will become handy whenever you decide to change your account's password.

## Changing Password

To change your password, you need to follow 3 simple steps on the _Account security_ section of the _Settings_ page.

**1.** Type your current password in the _Old password_ field.

**2.** Type your new password both in the _New password_ and _Confirm new password_ fields.

**3.** Click on **Update password** botton.

|   **Note:** Leaving the page without clicking on this button will not make any updates to your account's password.
