# Creating, Modifying, and Deleting Files in GitHub
{: .no_toc }

Though GitHub is not usually used as an interface for writing code, it does have the functionality to create, edit, delete files and create folders. 

This section’s goal is to explain and show you how to use these file manipulation techniques to add to your repositories. If you really wanted to, by the end of this section, you could start programming your applications in GitHub instead of an IDE.

To start, let’s create a repository. You can follow the previous, “Create / Delete a Repository”, task instructions if you need a refresher.

## Create a File

Depending on how the repository was created, with or without a README file, your repository page will look slightly different. Please see the two possible cases below, an empty repository / a repository with a file already in it,  to see what case matches your situation.

### Create a File From An Empty Repository

This case shows you how to create a file from a completely empty repository containing no files. For reference, your page should look similar to the image below.

!["Empty GitHub Repository Page"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/ChangingUsername.png?raw=true)

You should see some instructions that look complicated, but you don’t need to worry about any of these right now. We’re only going to be working in GitHub, so if your repository looks similar to this, please proceed.

**1.** Click on the **creating a new file** hyperlink, in the _Quick setup_ Section.




|   **Caution:** As changing _GitHub username_ may result in unintended side effects such as loosing redirects to your previously created Pages sites or repositories, prior to changing your username, read all the provided links by GitHub carefully.

**1.** Click on the **Change username** button after reading about **unintended side effects** by the provided link and probable consequences of changing a user account.

!["Changing GitHub Username"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/ChangingUsername.png?raw=true)

**2.** Click on the **I understand, let's change my username** button in the opened window if you agree and intend to proceed.

!["Warning for User account"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/UseraccountChangeWarning.png?raw=true)

**3.** Follow the steps of the loaded wizard, which is mostly the same as steps you took to create your previos GitHub account.

## Exporting Account Data

By following these steps, you can export all repositories and profile metadata of your account.

|   **Note:** A link to download your export request will be send to your _Backup email address_. You can change the related settings by taking the steps provided in the _Emails_ section of this instruction manual.

**1.** Click on the **Start export** button.

!["Export account data"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/ExportingAccountData.png?raw=true)

At this point, a message will be shown in this same box reporting that your exported is being prepared.

After some minutes depending on the some factors including the size of your repositories, you will receive an email (with a link similar to the picure below) in your chosen Backup Email Address for your GitHub account.

## Deleting GitHub Account

If at any point, you decide to delete your GitHub account and its repositories, you can do so by clicking on the red **Delete your account** on this _Account_ section of the _Settings_ page.

|   **Warning:** Once you delete your account by doing these steps, there is no going back. All of your repositories, along with all of your forks, pull requests, and GitHub pages sites will be deleted. Besides, your username will be available to anyone on GitHub.

**1.** Click on the red **Delete your account** button.

!["Deleting user account"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/DeletingAccount.png?raw=true)

At this point, you will receive a confirmation message in a pop-up window.

**2.**  Type your username or email address in the first field of this window, and type the shown confirmation message in the second. Once done, you can click on the **cancel plan and delete this account** button to completely remove your account and its data from GitHub.
