# Creating, Modifying, and Deleting Files in GitHub
{: .no_toc }

Though GitHub is not usually used as an interface for writing code, it does have the functionality to create, edit, delete files and create folders. 

This section’s goal is to explain and show you how to use these file manipulation techniques to add to your repositories. If you really wanted to, by the end of this section, you could start programming your applications in GitHub instead of an IDE.

To start, let’s create a repository. You can follow the previous, “Create / Delete a Repository”, task instructions if you need a refresher.

## Create a File

Depending on how the repository was created, with or without a README file, your repository page will look slightly different. Please see the two possible cases below, an empty repository / a repository with a file already in it,  to see what case matches your situation.

### Create a File From An Empty Repository

This case shows you how to create a file from a completely empty repository containing no files. For reference, your page should look similar to the image below.

!["Empty GitHub Repository Page"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image1EmptyRepositoryWebpage.PNG?raw=true)

You should see some instructions that look complicated, but you don’t need to worry about any of these right now. We’re only going to be working in GitHub, so if your repository looks similar to this, please proceed.

**1.** Click on the **creating a new file** hyperlink, in the _Quick setup_ Section.

For clarification, the hyperlink location is marked by the red box in the image below.

!["Empty GitHub Repository Page Create a New File Hyperlink Hightlight"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image2EmptyRepositoryWebpageCreateAFileHyperLinkHighlight.PNG?raw=true)

If this step was successful, you should see a new empty file page, as shown below.

!["New Empty File Editing Page"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image3NewEmptyFileEditingPage.PNG?raw=true)

Now you have successfully created a new file, but to edit and save it to your repository, please proceed to the “Writing and Commiting a File” subsection.

|   **Caution:** If you do not complete the “Writing and Commiting a File” task the file will not be saved.

### Create a File From a Repository Already Containing a File

This case shows you how to create a file from a repository already containing a file. For reference, your page should look similar to the image below.

!["GitHub Repository Page Already Containing Files"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image4RepositoryAlreadyContainingFiles.PNG?raw=true)

An easy way to check if this page matches your page is to look for the command bars highlighted by the red box in the image below. 

!["GitHub Repository Page Already Containing Files Identifier Highlight"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image5RepositoryAlreadyContainingFilesIdentifierHighlight.PNG?raw=true)

If you see the command line highlighted by the red box above, then this instructions is for you. Please note that other features of this page may differ depending on how many and what type of files you have in your repository already.

**1.** Click on the **Add File** button, in the previously mentioned command line, highlighted above

The **Add File** button has been highlighted in the image below.

If this step was successful, you should see a new empty file page, as shown below.

!["New Empty File Editing Page"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image3NewEmptyFileEditingPage.PNG?raw=true)

Now you have successfully created a new file, but to edit and save it to your repository, please proceed to the “Writing and Commiting a File” subsection.

## Writing and Commiting a File

Now that you have created or edited a file,you should now be at the file editing screen as shown below.

**5.** Write a descriptive commit message.

You can add a descriptive message to your commits to help track the changes you have made to your file. This is not mandatory, you can leave the message as it’s default if you would prefer.
For example, we left our commit message as the default message “Update testFile.py”, but your default message may be diff]reret.
