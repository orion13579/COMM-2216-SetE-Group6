# Creating, Modifying, and Deleting Files in GitHub
{: .no_toc }

Though GitHub is not usually used as an interface for writing code, it does have the functionality to create, edit, delete files and create folders. 

This section’s goal is to explain and show you how to use these file manipulation techniques to add to your repositories. If you really wanted to, by the end of this section, you could start programming your applications in GitHub instead of an IDE.

To start, let’s create a repository. You can follow the previous, “Create / Delete a Repository”, task instructions if you need a refresher.

## Create a File

Depending on how the repository was created, with or without a README file, your repository page will look slightly different. Please see the two possible cases below, an empty repository / a repository with a file already in it,  to see what case matches your situation.

### Create a File From An Empty Repository

This case shows you how to create a file from a completely empty repository containing no files. For reference, your page should look similar to the image below.

!["Empty GitHub Repository Page"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image1EmptyRepositoryWebpage.PNG?raw=true)

You should see some instructions that look complicated, but you don’t need to worry about any of these right now. We’re only going to be working in GitHub, so if your repository looks similar to this, please proceed.

**1.** Click on the **creating a new file** hyperlink, in the _Quick setup_ Section.

For clarification, the hyperlink location is marked by the red box in the image below.

!["Empty GitHub Repository Page Create a New File Hyperlink Hightlight"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image2EmptyRepositoryWebpageCreateAFileHyperLinkHighlight.PNG?raw=true)

If this step was successful, you should see a new empty file page, as shown below.

!["New Empty File Editing Page"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image3NewEmptyFileEditingPage.PNG?raw=true)

Now you have successfully created a new file, but to edit and save it to your repository, please proceed to the “Writing and Commiting a File” subsection.

|   **Caution:** If you do not complete the “Writing and Commiting a File” task the file will not be saved.

### Create a File From a Repository Already Containing a File

This case shows you how to create a file from a repository already containing a file. For reference, your page should look similar to the image below.

!["GitHub Repository Page Already Containing Files"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image4RepositoryAlreadyContainingFiles.PNG?raw=true)

An easy way to check if this page matches your page is to look for the command bars highlighted by the red box in the image below. 

!["GitHub Repository Page Already Containing Files Identifier Highlight"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image5RepositoryAlreadyContainingFilesIdentifierHighlight.PNG?raw=true)

If you see the command line highlighted by the red box above, then this instructions is for you. Please note that other features of this page may differ depending on how many and what type of files you have in your repository already.

**1.** Click on the **Add File** button, in the previously mentioned command line, highlighted above

The **Add File** button has been highlighted in the image below.

When the **Add File** button is clicked, a dropdown should appear below the Add File button as shown below.

!["Add File Button Dropdown"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image7AddFileDropdownZoomIn.PNG?raw=true)

**2.** Click on the **Create new file** dropdown button

This button has been highlighted in the image below.

!["Add File Button Dropdown Create New File Highlight"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image8AddFileDropdownZoomInCreateNewFileHighlight.PNG?raw=true)

If this step was successful, you should see a new empty file page, as shown below.

!["New Empty File Editing Page"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image3NewEmptyFileEditingPage.PNG?raw=true)

Now you have successfully created a new file, but to edit and save it to your repository, please proceed to the “Writing and Commiting a File” subsection.

## Writing and Commiting a File

Now that you have created or edited a file,you should now be at the file editing screen as shown below. 

!["File Editing Page Features"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image9FileEditingPageFeatures.PNG?raw=true)

This is where you can modify the contents, name, location, or even type of your file.

The top of this page has two important features:
[]The top of this page has two important features: 

1.  This text box is where you can input or edit the file name and type of your file. 
2.  This is where you can modify the contents of your file by adding, editing, or removing lines of code.

**1.** Give this file a name.

For example, we gave our file the name “testFile” as seen below:

!["Add File Name"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image10AddFileName.PNG?raw=true)

**2.** Give this file an extension.

!["Add File Extension"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image11AddFileExtension.PNG?raw=true)

|   **Note:** You can give your file any common extensions used in common programming languages, but the doc notation is mandatory for the file extension.

**3.** Add some file contents.

Any content is fine, you could also make no changes. In our case, we added the following contents.

!["Sample File Contents"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image12SampleFileContentsAdded.PNG?raw=true)

**4.** Scroll to the bottom of the page.

At the very bottom of the page you should see a Commit Changes section, as shown below.

!["File Commit Box"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image13CommitFileBox.PNG?raw=true)

**5.** Write a descriptive commit message.

You can add a descriptive message to your commits to help track the changes you have made to your file. This is not mandatory, you can leave the message as it’s default if you would prefer.
For example, we left our commit message as the default message “Update testFile.py”, but your default message may be diff]reret.

!["File Commit Box Commit Message Highlight"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image14CommitFileBoxMessgaeHighlight.PNG?raw=true)

**6.** Click **Commit changes** button.

!["File Commit Box Commit Changes Button Highlight"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image15CommitFileBoxCommitChangesButtonHighlight.PNG?raw=true)

This will save your file changes to your repository.

## Edit a File

Once a file is created it is not immutable, you can edit it’s contents, name, location, and even it’s type.

This section will show you how to access a file and edit it in the above mentioned ways.

To start, you should have your repository opened to it’s home page, with at least one file already in it. If your repository is empty, please refer to the Create a File instructions above.

At this point your screen should look similar to the image below.

!["Repository Containing a File"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image16RepositoryContainingAFile.PNG?raw=true)

**1.** Click on the name of the file you want to edit.

The image below shows the general location of the file names.

!["Repository Containing a File, File Name Hightlight"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image17RepositoryContainingAFileFileNameHighlight.PNG?raw=true)

Each file in your repository will have it’s own row, so look through the rows to find the file you want to edit.

If successful, you should arrive at the file specific screen that looks similar to below.

!["File Specifc Page"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image18FileSpecificPage.PNG?raw=true)

**2.** Click on the pencil icon.

Some key feature of this page include:
1. This is the path to the file you selected. In this example, the path shows that you are looking at the “testFile.py” file in the “test” repository. This path may be different for you depending on what you named your repository and files.
|   **Note:** an easy way to return to your main repository page is that you can click on any parent directories, such as the “test” repository in the path mentioned above.
2. This area provides general file information such as how many lines are in your file and the size of your file.
3. These are the main tools for manipulating your files. We will only be looking at the pencil and trashcan tool in this instruction manual.
4. This section contains the contents of your file. In this example we only have a single line in our file, but if you had many lines you could see them all here.

!["File Specifc Page, Edit File Icon Hightlight"](https://github.com/orion13579/COMM-2216-SetE-Group6/blob/gh-pages/assets/images/Section3Image19FileSpecificPageEditHighlight.PNG?raw=true)

If this step was successful, you should see the editing page for your file, as discussed in the “Writing and Commiting a File” subsection.
